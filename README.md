# Programming-Bootcamp
This is a basic snake duplicate game that I have done by the end of the two weeks programming bootcamp at City University of London.
It's surely far from perfect, but prior the bootcamp I had no initial know what so ever in programming.

Also as you can see there's a read me file that explains a few errors that I was unable to fix by myself;
if anyone has any idea how to do it I would me more than happy to discuss about it!
